when app will send request to api you can change src ip to local host to get information with response of api or have admin access and change something
http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
some times the request filteered from network ip add so you can give src ip in network range
stockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin
Some applications block input containing hostnames like 127.0.0.1 and localhost, or sensitive URLs like /admin. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using various techniques:
    Using an alternative IP representation of 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1.
    Registering your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net for this purpose.
    Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
every where of site you have redirection you can attack openredirect so copy url and use as ssrf connection
/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=14&path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
-------^ found on redirect url ^--------&------------^ ssrf attack ^--------------
some times you can change referer for ssrf attack
