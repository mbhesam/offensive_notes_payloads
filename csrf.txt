In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer.
you can use  CSRF PoC generator to make html page that when victim load it send request to change email url in site with last header browsing 
so if victim logged into site before, we can change email without undrestanding of victim.
